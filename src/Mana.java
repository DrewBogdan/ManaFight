     * from. allow people to instantiate mana to hold a value, but
     * players have a mana object attached to them that has methods
     * to subtract mana from one another. and allows the mana gain
     * to be hindered by percentile through effects.
     * Maybe a secondary class called playerMana as a child class
     * of mana that contains the player only methods with effects and shit
     * whereas base mana is just a number and tostring and shit like that?
